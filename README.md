License plate recognition system based on MATLAB 
 
This is a simple and accurate method. 
This method realizes license plate location based on color features. The blue search is realized in HSI space, and the license plate area is judged by finding the circumscribed rectangle of the suspected area. 
The character segmentation is realized by vertical projection and connected domain analysis. 
3.Character recognition is realized by three-layer neural network.
